<div class="mt-4">

ðŸ¦§ Hello! I am an orangutan conservationist and former primate cognition researcher who is now focused on supply chain sustainability and consulting. 

My MSc project explores how a language-trained ape recognizes virtual objects representationally within virtual reality. 

I hold a masterâ€™s degree in Psychology from the University of St. Andrews and a bachelorâ€™s degree in Cognitive and Behavioral Neuroscience from the University of California, San Diego. 

My main hobbies include singing and baking, and I am always trying out new makeup techniques. Feel free to reach out!
